      <description>Should I write this int flag = 0; # Boolean value, can only be 0 or 1 while(some_condition){ ... if(flag == 0) flag = 1; ... }  or int flag = 0; while(some_condition){ ... flag = 1; ... }  what performs better? While I was writing some C code I came up to this little question. In a while loop at a certain point we have to set a boolean flag&amp;rsquo;s value to 1.</description>

      <description>I had 1.30 euro remaining on my GOG wallet and I had to use them before sept. 19 or I would lose them. So I started to search on the GOG Store for a game whose price would be less or equal to 1.30 euro and greater than 0€ (since I wasn&amp;rsquo;t searching a free game&amp;hellip;) but the default filters of the website&amp;rsquo;s search engine allowed me to filter only games whose price was less than 5€.</description>
