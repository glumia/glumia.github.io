      <description>Too lazy to write something long and well tought now ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Just a bit disappointed by how bad Clojure&amp;rsquo;s performance are (but hey, immutability is not free!) and by how damn difficult it is to improve them.
Update 23/06/20
I found out that the timing of the C version goes down to ~2ms if I just declare the variables as int and not unsigned int. That&amp;rsquo;s amazing!

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s fascinating how everything you can think of in computer science 9 times out of 10 was already thought and probably studied by someone else. Today I was thinking about a way to suggest corrections for addresses inserted by our customers when I started to imagine an algorithm that used the mathematical notion of &amp;lsquo;distance&amp;rsquo; (check &amp;lsquo;Metric (mathematics)&amp;rsquo; on Wikipedia 1 ) to give them some suggestions based on a set of valid addresses present on our DB.</description>

      <title>C and Assembly - Subtleties</title>

      <description>Should I write this int flag = 0;	# Boolean value, can only be 0 or 1 while(some_condition){ ... if(flag == 0) flag = 1; ... }  or int flag = 0; while(some_condition){ ... flag = 1; ... }  what performs better? While I was writing some C code I came up to this little question. In a while loop at a certain point we have to set a boolean flag&amp;rsquo;s value to 1.</description>

      <title>GOG Store - Overkill search</title>

      <description>I had 1.30 euro remaining on my GOG wallet and I had to use them before sept. 19 or I would lose them. So I started to search on the GOG Store for a game whose price would be less or equal to 1.30 euro and greater than 0€ (since I wasn&amp;rsquo;t searching a free game&amp;hellip;) but the default filters of the website&amp;rsquo;s search engine allowed me to filter only games whose price was less than 5€.</description>
