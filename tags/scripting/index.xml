I started to look for a game but store&amp;rsquo;s search engine didn&amp;rsquo;t allow me to filter them for a price in a custom range. I could only search for games whose price was less than 5 euros, and this still yield to 530 results. Too many to check them one by one.</description></item></channel></rss>
