      <description>I had 1.30 euro remaining on my GOG wallet and I had to use them before sept. 19 or I would lose them. So I started to search on the GOG Store for a game whose price would be less or equal to 1.30 euro and greater than 0€ (since I wasn&amp;rsquo;t searching a free game&amp;hellip;) but the default filters of the website&amp;rsquo;s search engine allowed me to filter only games whose price was less than 5€.</description>
