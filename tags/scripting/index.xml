&lt;p>I had 1.30 euro remaining on my GOG wallet and I had to use them before Sept. 19 or they
would expire. I started to look for a game but store&amp;rsquo;s search engine didn&amp;rsquo;t allow me to
filter them for a price in a custom range. I could only search for games whose
price was less than 5 euros, and this still yield to 530 results. Too many to
check them one by one. Given that I&amp;rsquo;m lazy I worked my way out to automate the search
using the GOG API and a simple Python script.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
