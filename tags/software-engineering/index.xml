As I usually do, I skimmed through the comments and decided to stop there - more often than not it&amp;rsquo;s enough information to decide if a full read is worth it or noth (yeah, I know, that&amp;rsquo;s not an infallible heuristic, but hey, our time on this world is limited and even if I would like to I can&amp;rsquo;t read and keep up with everything that&amp;rsquo;s on the web).</description></item></channel></rss>
