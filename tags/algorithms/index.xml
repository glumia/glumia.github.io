10 was already tackled and solved by someone else. Today I was thinking about a
way to suggest corrections for addresses inserted by our customers when I started to
imagine an algorithm that used the mathematical notion of &amp;lsquo;distance&amp;rsquo; (check &amp;lsquo;Metric
(mathematics)&amp;rsquo; on Wikipedia &lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> ) to give them some suggestions based on a set of valid
addresses present on our DB. Well, now I find out that it&amp;rsquo;s a well-known problem in
computer science, that a wide range of algorithms&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> has already been designed to solve
it and that what I had in my mind was a variation of the Levenshtein distance!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
