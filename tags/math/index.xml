Just a bit disappointed by how bad Clojure&amp;rsquo;s performance are (but hey, immutability is not free!) and by how damn difficult it is to improve them.
Update 23/06/20 I found out that the timing of the C version goes down to ~2ms if I just declare the variables as int and not unsigned int. That&amp;rsquo;s amazing!
Update 09/01/21 Half I year later I finally know why the version with signed integers actually takes less than the version with unsigned ints.</description></item></channel></rss>
